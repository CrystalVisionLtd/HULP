            In calculating some timings, use hardcoded approximate fast clock frequency instead of querying accurate frequency at runtime.

            Slow clock cycles to use to determine fast clock frequency.

        help
            UART transmit will use push-pull configuration by default. Enable this to use open drain instead.
            External pullups may be required for higher baud rates.
